# D3-Challenge

## Background

Welcome to the newsroom! As a new data visualization analyst for a major metro paper, we have tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives. The analysis will be based on interactive charts and elements, leveraing our visualization expertise. 

The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on you to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The data set included with the request is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state.

## Before You Begin

1. This assignment utilizes both **html** and **Javascript** so be sure to add all the necessary files. These will be the main files to run for analysis.

2. This assignment will use **Javascript** to access csv data on the local repository. In order to do this, the repository will need to be hosted on a localhost using **python -m http.server** in the terminal. 

## Your Task

### Primary

Using D3, we are tasked with creating a scatter plot between two of the data variables within the 2014 ACS estimates. 
- Each circle element in the scatter plot is to represent an individual state with its X and Y coordinates associated with the selected variables. 
- State abbreviations are to be included inside each circle element

### Bonus

In order to keep customers on their toes, the boss has asked us to make the chart dynamic, enabling the customer to select which variables they want to compare visualy on the scatter plot.
